# Compendium matching rules and maintainer decisions

This is the central reference for matching, scope, category placement and withheld outcomes. Rule IDs below are the exact `ruleId` values returned by code. Explicit owner decisions take precedence over inference; neither blank authored English nor an absent name proves no equivalent. Saved links/drafts/review decisions are preserved. A current baseline, frozen membership and source confirmation are required before proposing links; no rule here publishes data.

## General rules, narrow rules and their validation

`triageRules.test.ts` separates construction examples (the 282 owner-triaged records) from independent real manifest definitions and structural counterexamples. `ownerReviewed.test.ts`, `guidedDecisions.test.tsx`, `reviewScope.test.ts` and core compendium suites cover earlier rules. Source hashes are change detectors; manifest descriptions, socket/plug categories, actual source cells and item identity supply the semantic evidence. General inference never follows a parent-card mention alone. New item-specific decisions belong in the generated registry below, not in ad hoc name guesses.

| Rule ID | Matches / evidence / limits | Validation examples and counterexamples |
|---|---|---|
| <!-- ruleId: armor-set-perk-piece-count --> `armor-set-perk-piece-count` | Armor set-bonus catalog identity supplies the set name and 2/4 piece count. Remove only a trailing ` Set`; require the exact first-line set heading in Armor Perks / Armor Set Bonuses, and the exact `N Piece | Perk name` heading. Require one round-trippable styled block; ambiguous, missing, or renamed perks remain unresolved. Maintainer exception: Wayward Psyche Set = Uncaged Deviants. Provenance: owner, 2026-11-04, `.agents/t3/decisions-1104/decisions.html`, decision 4, “A: Link all five”. | Disaster Corps, Smoke Jumper, Iron Panoply, Wayward Psyche, and Iron Battalion, both piece counts; wrong perk/count, duplicate card, and set-conversion selectors reject. |
| <!-- ruleId: exotic-class-item-perk --> `exotic-class-item-perk` | Exotic Class Item perks (`armor-trait-exotic-class-item`) are shared by all three class items, so the perk, not an armour piece, is the identity. Link only when exactly one row in the Exotic Class tab has the exact normalized perk name (full name or a name line) and the selection round-trips as one non-multipart cell; otherwise unresolved with a reason. Membership is the shipped `catalog:armor-trait-exotic-class-item` record (36 perks, generator v2). Provenance: owner 2026-11-12, Exotic Class Items are their own editor category; root brief `.agents/t3/preview-feedback-1104/MATCHER-CLASS-ITEMS.md` (2026-11-12). | `classItemPerks.test.ts`: real Spirit of the Swarm/Spirit of Galanor rows link; a duplicated name, a missing name, and a non-class-item category reject. Live census: 34 of 36 high; 0 other catalogue links changed. |
| <!-- ruleId: exotic-class-item-article --> `exotic-class-item-article` | Class item perk with no exact Exotic Class row whose name differs only by the optional "the" after "Spirit of" (Spirit of Inmost Light = Spirit of the Inmost Light; Spirit of Synthoceps = Spirit of the Synthoceps). Exotic Class tab only; the stem must match exactly one row there, the selection must round-trip as one non-multipart cell, and no other class item perk may share the stem. A shared stem stays a medium proposal; no other prefix or article is stripped. Provenance: root ruling 2026-11-12 (Class item matcher), owner category decision 2026-11-12. | `classItemPerks.test.ts`: both live article cases link; a stem shared with another class item perk stays medium; two rows sharing the stem reject. Live census: Spirit of Inmost Light 1476923953 and Spirit of Synthoceps 1476923956. |
| <!-- ruleId: owner-reapproved-collective --> `owner-reapproved-collective` | Owner, 2026-11-04, decision 3 on `.agents/t3/decisions-1104/decisions.html`: “A: Re-approve rows 52/53”. Hash/name/category and exact styled body must agree with `owner-reviewed.json` reapproved records. Demolition 4019266109/2613226185 selects row 52; Pugilism 1888882410/3684445958 selects rewritten row 53, never old-text row 54. Pick the named card with an explicit sourceAnchor and relative description-cell offsets to avoid combining duplicate names. Original approval snapshots (bootstrap Compendium commit 6cdb31a, matching the former withholding fingerprints) supply read-only drift comparisons; renewed link approval does not approve tooltip numbers. | All four approvals, changed source/identity rejection, and fresh-storage shipped matching. |
| <!-- ruleId: armor-siphon-family --> `armor-siphon-family` | Approved element/damage-family Siphon naming on a real `enhancements.v2_head` helmet plug; unique Armor Mods / Helmet / Siphon description must describe weapon kills and Orbs. No row coordinates or hash allowlist. | Independent Harmonic 3832366019, Kinetic 897335593 and Solar 1086997255; artifact Elemental Siphon, Health Siphon, duplicate Helmet rows and a wrong buff description reject. All five triage variants pass. |
| <!-- ruleId: armor-core-variant --> `armor-core-variant` | Existing core variants/identifiers, configured tab and unique round-trippable description. Element/harmonic families, resistance and Set Bonus prefix normalization are source hints; semantic selector scope wins over an old name-only Set Bonus match. | Frozen 69 armour disagreements; independent Siphon cases above, owner-sample/multipart guards. Set-conversion New Demotic is excluded, not linked to its actual bonus card. |
| <!-- ruleId: weapon-attachment --> `weapon-attachment` | Default Weapon Attachments exclusion. Inference requires a recognised physical attachment plug on `weapon-perk`, unconditional nonzero investment stats, no effect perks and no effect wording in the manifest description (damage, a firing mode, detonation, chaining, blinding, bouncing, Overcharge or ability energy; stat bullet lines ignored). Explicit triage defaults override uncertain inference only for recorded identities. No first-two-column assumption. | Independent Arrowhead Brake 839105230, Hammer-Forged Rifling 3250034553, Hitmark IS 13792278, Tactical Mag 106909392 and Assault Mag 791862061; Ricochet 1885400500, Armour-Piercing 1968497646 and High-Caliber 1561002382 must remain in scope; conditional/stale facts reject. |
| <!-- ruleId: attachment-saved-text --> `attachment-saved-text` | Owner, 2026-11-11: an item that already has tooltip text is never listed as stat-only by a rule. A manifest `weapon-attachment` inference with saved or drafted text is Attachment Effects, in scope, tooltip required. Owner triage records and editor overrides are not overridden; the category switch disables "No tooltip" while the text exists. | statOnlyListing.test.ts (Tempered Truss Rod with and without text, Honed Edge owner triage kept) and the switch first-text/last-text/save-reload regressions. |
| <!-- ruleId: attachment-evidence-needed --> `attachment-evidence-needed` | Known attachment plug with effect perks, effect wording, conditional or insufficient stat evidence is Attachment Effects, in scope, not inferred stat-only. No source equivalence is implied. | Independent Ricochet, Armour-Piercing and High-Caliber; Rangefinder 2846385770 and Quickdraw 706527188 are frame/trait plugs and are not reclassified as attachments. |
| <!-- ruleId: owner-classification-evidence-changed --> `owner-classification-evidence-changed` | A recorded exclusion no longer agrees with manifest identity, plug or description; keep in scope and withhold matching until category/scope is confirmed. Explicit exclusions are not blind permanent hash rules. | Changed Chambered Compensator manifest description rejects the old owner exclusion; exact original owner cases remain covered by all 282 disposition regressions. |
| <!-- ruleId: attachment-source-investigation --> `attachment-source-investigation` | Explicit seven unresolved attachment sources (base/enhanced counterparts inherit only the same named family via catalog relationships). Six required tooltips; Remote Detonation tentative. Never promote a generic parent/exotic mention. | All seven authoritative hashes below plus Coils base/enhanced relationships; fake shared names or unrelated relationships cannot inherit the exception. |
| <!-- ruleId: editor-attachment-effect --> `editor-attachment-effect` | Saved/drafted `custom.categoryId=attachment-effect` promotes a classified attachment into Attachment Effects. Normal drafts/save/conflict flow; server and control require editor or maintainer for a category change. Does not approve a source. | Arrowhead promotion preserves later English/associations; editor/maintainer accepted, trial/translator/anonymous rejected; hydration/save lock disable the control; unchanged-category text edits retain ordinary permissions. |
| <!-- ruleId: editor-attachment-override --> `editor-attachment-override` | Saved/drafted `custom.categoryId=weapon-attachment` moves an owner/manifest-classified Attachment Effect (or attachment) into Weapon Attachments (no tooltip needed). Switching back to the native category removes the override. Editor or maintainer only; does not approve a source. | Native effect moved to attachments and back is byte-identical; trial/translator/anonymous rejected. |
| <!-- ruleId: enhanced-mod --> `enhanced-mod` | Owner, 2026-11-14: generator-paired enhanced weapon mods are edited with their base and need no separate tooltip. Unlinked mods stay separate; existing text, links, and consumer output are preserved. | `reviewScope.test.ts`, `variants.test.ts`, and core `aliasGroups.test.ts`. |
| <!-- ruleId: enhanced-part --> `enhanced-part` | Owner, 2026-11-09: enhanced weapon parts (`weapon-perk-enhanced`) are edited with their base and never need a tooltip of their own. Exclude paired and base-less enhanced parts from default Compendium scope, translation queues, coverage, and enhanced-wording worklists; preserve existing links, text, and consumer output. | `reviewScope.test.ts` checks exclusion and saved-link preservation; `queue.test.ts` checks paired and base-less parts while retaining enhanced perks; core `aliasGroups.test.ts` checks differing manifest wording. |
| <!-- ruleId: inactive-placeholder --> `inactive-placeholder` | Deprecated plug or exact locked-mod manifest template, with no stats/perks, becomes Inactive & Placeholder Items. Explicit 29 owner placements retained. Data stays viewable; deprecation is not archival. | Independent Opening Salvo 1254077559 and locked class-item mod 2535142633; Empty Mod Socket 1980618587 has neither deprecation nor unlock semantics and rejects. |
| <!-- ruleId: manifest-armor-stat --> `manifest-armor-stat` | Armour general/tuning plug changing only known player armour stats/costs; explicit thirteen owner exclusions also cover facts insufficient for inference. | Independent +Melee/-Super 311164277 and +Class/-Weapons 323635379 pass. Cost-only Minor Class 1124184622 / Melee 1763607626 stay unclassified by inference; empty sockets and unknown stat/effect evidence reject. |
| <!-- ruleId: irrelevant-selector --> `irrelevant-selector` | Manifest set-conversion selector plug plus conversion semantics, or explicit owner selector decision; never the actual set bonus. | Independent New Demotic selector 139044974; empty selector socket 666522389 is not a conversion effect; a genuine set-effect/ordinary armour plug cannot be inferred from its name. Accretion/Wayward Psyche are explicit exclusions. |
| <!-- ruleId: irrelevant-extractor --> `irrelevant-extractor` | Crafting extractor plug and obtain-pattern-progress semantics; a crafting action, not a tooltip effect. | Extract Pattern 1791833453 is construction evidence; independent raw definition 2897206615 passes, Empty Deepsight Socket 1961918267 rejects. A trait merely mentioning patterns or a different plug/description cannot infer this classification. Scope is deliberately smaller than all crafting plugs. |
| <!-- ruleId: weapon-mod-stat --> `weapon-mod-stat` | Explicit owner category/scope for Enhanced Heat Generated and Enhanced Vent Speed: Weapon Mods, no tooltip. No inferred rule for arbitrary heat/perk names. | Both owner hashes below; independent effect-bearing magazines/traits remain outside this exception. |
| <!-- ruleId: optional-movement --> `optional-movement` | Exact 53 triage movement records: retained, optional authoring, history/source investigation unresolved. Not exclusion or no-equivalent. | Every group 6–8 member checked; no blank-English exclusion. Original five guided movement negatives remain unchanged by ROOT clarification. |
| <!-- ruleId: artifact-identity-unresolved --> `artifact-identity-unresolved` | Explicit rejection: Elemental Siphon versions have different mechanics and unresolved plug/artifact mapping. | 3619040076; actual two source cells differ; core refuses their combination. Same-name agreement and the reused Implement of Curiosity preview family are insufficient. |
| <!-- ruleId: artifact-manifest-section --> `artifact-manifest-section` | Link only within a current sheet artifact section supported by manifest socket parents. Truly shared identical descriptions can use existing multipart links with all validated current parents, one match per section. | Armorsmith 2903198437 under Encrypted Data Disk and Queensfoil Censer; extra unsupported third card rejects. Different Elemental Siphon mechanics reject even when names agree. |
| <!-- ruleId: artifact-sunset --> `artifact-sunset` | A proven socket parent absent from the sheet current-artifact section list is excluded, with reason “not in a current artifact.” Missing parents alone are not proof. | Current/sunset same-name and sunset-only regressions; no current sections/unknown identity is withheld. Frozen baseline has zero proven-parent sunset cases. |
| <!-- ruleId: artifact-source-absent --> `artifact-source-absent` | Exact twelve owner-approved absent artifacts, only while no socket parent and no named current sheet source. | All twelve exclusions; Impact, Shock, Gravity owner sample is not included. A newly added source or parent invalidates the exclusion. |
| <!-- ruleId: owner-artifact-identity --> `owner-artifact-identity` | Withhold ambiguous/unestablished artifact identities; source anchors remain available for manual review. | Distinct names/rows do not establish current ownership; old preview.artifactHash reused across artifacts is rejected. |
| <!-- ruleId: owner-verified-multirow --> `owner-verified-multirow` | Explicit verified hash/name/category groups, complete source identity set and styled-cell evidence; combines via existing core. Physical description components must concatenate exactly to the parsed cell. Only identical **cooldown metadata** is shared once; variant bodies/labels remain. No weapon-type routing. Relocated rows and changed authored English do not change the approved item/source identity; new/changed source bodies or members are withheld. | Micro-Missile both cells, Hammer ordinary/Sol Invictus plus one cooldown. Independent real Glacier and Golden Gun compound-cell recovery; synthetic Nova Dive variants exercise shared/different cooldowns and relocation. Different Golden Gun identities and distinct Elemental Siphon never merge. |
| <!-- ruleId: owner-verified-cell --> `owner-verified-cell` | Individually reviewed core destination with exact item/source evidence. Slicewire includes its parsed description and cooldown. No extrapolation to all aspect/grenade names. | Six Arc/Stasis aspects and Slicewire entries below; changed/wrong neighboring cell is withheld. Independent Glacier compound-cell recovery tests the reusable structural detector. |
| <!-- ruleId: exotic-armor-card --> `exotic-armor-card` | Normal single armour card. Repeated item anchors collapse only when the same styled description physically spans both anchors in the same column. Parser uses real elements; resolver supports older published parsed data. | Swarmers and Blastwave Striders; synthetic repeated-name merged card; identical text in a separate physical cell remains multipart/ambiguous. |
| <!-- ruleId: owner-reviewed-evidence-changed --> `owner-reviewed-evidence-changed` | Withhold a known reviewed item when its hash/name/category identity, complete source set, styled description or core agreement no longer validates. Global sheet coordinates and authored text are not item identity. | Every reviewed record is tested with changed neighboring mechanics; added Adaptive row rejects; coordinate-only relocation keeps identity and source content. |
| <!-- ruleId: source-text-changed --> `source-text-changed` | Four Collective base/enhanced selections from the approved 2026-11-02 matcher baseline changed real text on Nov 3. Keep them withheld until a current explicit owner reference is saved. Pinned styled body fingerprints are in changedSourceEvidence.json. | Pinned matcher replay withholds all four; current explicit references take precedence. |
| <!-- ruleId: owner-tentative-no-equivalent --> `owner-tentative-no-equivalent` | Only exact named decision-7 / finalized triage records below, bound to full-sheet and entry fingerprints using existing `localDecision`. ROOT withdrew the 291-record blanket. | All remaining 29 records reopen after sheet additions or entry changes. Coils investigations, Siphons, movement, placeholders and unrelated blanks are not inferred no-equivalent. |
| <!-- ruleId: exotic-catalog-parent --> `exotic-catalog-parent` | Exact manifest/editor parent item names establish an exotic card. Unique parent preferred; otherwise validate the core-selected row/column/cell. Generic exotic barrel/ornament parent-only promotion is forbidden, including the seventeen superseded exceptions. | Ranked Cranial Spike, catalyst/refit, actual multi-parent selection and wrong-parent negatives; Default Ornament/Balanced Grip never inherit the whole weapon row. |
| <!-- ruleId: exotic-name-line-or-catalyst --> `exotic-name-line-or-catalyst` | Token/catalyst-name convention in an owner-demonstrated tab, requiring confirmation (medium), not automatic parent semantics. | Existing token/catalyst tests, no positive reference tab and competing token rows withhold. Parent-only negatives remain meaningful. |
| <!-- ruleId: explicit-owner --> `explicit-owner` | Current reference applies only to its own hash/category/evidence/baseline. Never category-wide approval. Formatter-only multipart upgrades are allowed only when replaying the saved labels over the current complete styled source rows reproduces the old approved snapshot and source hash; changed bodies/member sets reject. Exact frozen references and original negatives are generated below. | Stale source/entry/membership, note-only/skipped references and changed baselines reject; source selection still round-trips. |
| <!-- ruleId: unique-name-in-learned-tab --> `unique-name-in-learned-tab` | Unique normalized full/first-line name in a current owner-demonstrated tab, with stable source confirmation. | Guided fixture independent Sample 102 from owner Sample 100; duplicate names, missing anchors/cells and no current positive references withhold. |
| <!-- ruleId: fragment-short-name --> `fragment-short-name` | Known Facet/Whisper/Ember/Spark/Echo/Thread prefix convention in learned source tabs; no arbitrary prefix stripping. | Existing fragment/alias core suites and fragment guidance; unrelated names and competing elemental sources are not proof. |
| <!-- ruleId: owner-shared-armor-family --> `owner-shared-armor-family` | Explicit shared Ammo Finder / elemental Weapon Surge convention in a learned tab. Not all armour mod names. | Existing shared-family fixtures and source confirmation; wrong tab, duplicate identity and unresolved owner sample reject. |
| <!-- ruleId: separated-fuzzy-name --> `separated-fuzzy-name` | Similarity >=0.65, margin >=0.08, learned tabs and stable cells; medium confirmation only. | Existing guided separated candidate / close runner-up tests. Similarity or a parent mention never makes this high-confidence approval. |
| <!-- ruleId: separated-typo-name --> `separated-typo-name` | Full normalized name >=8 chars, edit distance <=2 and runner-up distance gap >=2; medium confirmation. | Precise Jolts/Precise Jolt fixture; short strings and close competing candidates reject. |
| <!-- ruleId: uncovered-element-tab --> `uncovered-element-tab` | A unique exact subclass/verb name outside a demonstrated tab is medium, requiring tab-convention confirmation. | Existing cross-element guidance tests; several elemental hits/Prismatic variants remain ambiguous. |
| <!-- ruleId: exact-name-in-sibling-element-tab --> `exact-name-in-sibling-element-tab` | Owner, 2026-11-05, ask dialog at 11:5x: “Approve the rule (Rec.)”. A category's exact-unique-name convention learned from usable positive whole-row references on at least three distinct configured sibling element tabs extends to its remaining configured element tabs; Prismatic counts. Preserve frozen membership, approved fragment-prefix normalization, exact uniqueness, stable source selection, baseline/source-evidence gates, and owner negatives. Renames, selected-cell/multipart samples, and non-element tabs do not teach this convention. | `siblingElementTabs.test.ts`: three distinct tabs including Prismatic, fragment normalization, insufficient/repeated/stale samples, owner negatives, frozen membership, ambiguous names, unconfigured tabs, and source drift. |
| <!-- ruleId: owner-multipart-source --> `owner-multipart-source` | Unverified duplicate/multipart identity is withheld; raw anchors retained, not resolver-generated neighboring headings. | Unsupported third Armorsmith card and additional Adaptive rows; known owned groups use verified evidence, not this fallback. |
| <!-- ruleId: owner-no-candidate --> `owner-no-candidate` | Default withheld state, missing/stale samples, comments requiring interpretation, incompatible scope/baseline or no supported identity. Reasons explain which gate failed; not a no-equivalent finding. | Existing preservation, baseline, comments and stale-owner tests; empty authored English alone does not remove an entry. |
| <!-- ruleId: manifest-weapon-stat --> `manifest-weapon-stat` | Original supported stat-only scope; the seventeen historic exotic part identities remain Not needed only without authored or effect text. Never link them to a whole weapon row. Editor promotion takes precedence. | Frozen scope regressions and exotic part census; conditional/effect text and saved text require review. |
| <!-- ruleId: exotic-part-no-weapon-row --> `exotic-part-no-weapon-row` | Supersedes the seventeen `approvedExoticStat` whole-weapon links. Exotic parts with saved or effect text remain unmatched for review; text-free stat parts remain Not needed with an explicit reason. Preserve saved links, true named effects, and explicit-owner links outside these seventeen. Provenance: owner 2026-11-11, “it is obviously a perk on an exotic weapon that is for that exotic weapon”, and “Skip + fix the matcher (Rec.)”; root clarified all seventeen on 2026-11-12. `owner-exceptions.json` retains the historic identities. | Barrel and ornament regressions, all seventeen live before/after entries, saved/draft preservation, named-effect controls, and frozen matcher census. |
| <!-- ruleId: manifest-retired-mod --> `manifest-retired-mod` | Original owner-supported no-equivalent family with manifest deprecated/fizzled semantics; original 27 outcomes remain unchanged. New triage deprecated placements are separately inactive, not archived. | Existing manifestRule support/template regressions; no support or misleading description rejects; no manifest-removal archive in this round. |
| <!-- ruleId: manifest-weapon-ornament --> `manifest-weapon-ornament` | Original supported ornament predicate: appearance semantics plus matching manifest categories; no broad exotic-card link. | Version Alpha/One/Prime original guided population; wrong categories/description reject. |
| <!-- ruleId: manifest-adept-mod --> `manifest-adept-mod` | Original owner-supported Adept predicate requires stats, exact requirement perk and stat-only description. Named decision-7 Adept negatives are separate explicit records. | Existing manifestRule tests for perk/requirement/template guards; effect-bearing Adept perks are not swept in. |
| <!-- ruleId: ghost-mod --> `ghost-mod` | Existing ghost-mod scope excluded by default; config can include it. No change from triage. | Existing reviewScope config/preservation tests; real non-ghost descriptions and saved links are not removed by a name match. |

### Attachment category switch identity guard

The two-way switch is enabled only when the tooltip has no `custom` identity, or `custom` exactly matches what the switch writes: the manifest name and the opposite of the native owner/manifest attachment category. Returning to the native category removes that override, restoring the original tooltip JSON even after save/reload. Other custom identities disable both buttons with a note directing users to the identity editor; the updater also leaves them untouched. This includes a manifest-named custom in the native attachment category or a non-attachment category, and any differently named custom.

No provenance or schema field is added. Accepted limitation (owner decision): a pre-existing custom byte-identical to a switch-created override is indistinguishable and remains switchable; removing it yields the same visible native classification. Regressions in `AttachmentCategoryControl.switch.test.tsx` cover guarded identities before/after save/reload, saved switch overrides in both directions, and identity changes in a draft.

### Core candidate and saved-link mechanics

These are shared subroutines used by the runtime rule families above, not additional owner approvals. `config.ts` supplies category tab preferences; `OLD` tabs are excluded. Fragment prefixes route Spark/Ember/Echo/Whisper/Thread/Facet to Arc/Solar/Void/Stasis/Strand/Prismatic respectively. Set Bonus armour names prefer Armor Perks; ordinary armour mods prefer Armor Mods. Exotic weapon traits/frames/catalysts prefer Exotic Weapons, exotic armour prefers Exotic Armors/Exotic Class, and ordinary weapon perks prefer Weapon Perks. Unknown category routing remains a hint, never identity evidence.

`compendiumNameVariants` strips known fragment prefixes, Set Bonus prefixes, elemental/harmonic armour prefixes, Heavy/Special Ammo Finder/Scout prefixes, grenade suffixes and catalyst suffixes only within their configured category. Its exact older exotic/catalyst aliases are generated below. `compendiumIdentifiers` recognizes multiline names, leading arrows/plus signs and valid I–X rank ranges. Normalization removes trailing parenthetical/bracket qualifiers, decomposes accents, folds case, expands ampersands and collapses punctuation. Direct identifiers precede normalized names, configured variants, catalog/base names and alias-family names. Preferred tabs are searched in order before tracked-tab fallback. These mechanics feed `armor-core-variant`, `fragment-short-name`, `exotic-catalog-parent` and the learned-name rules, each with its own approval gates.

Core proposals can combine same normalized names only within one tab and one configured category boundary; the guided matcher additionally requires approved multipart identity. Physical merged armour cards deduplicate by cell identity, not merely equal text. Saved section names disambiguate category collisions; ordered relative-cell overrides must resolve completely and never fall back to configured cells. Saved links search their original tab/name first and then normalized relocated names. Styled snapshots and multipart labels detect changes. Trigram Dice similarity >=0.6 supplies at most three fallback candidates, ordered by similarity then tab/row; candidates never approve a match. Alias cycles, incomplete cell selections, missing anchors and unsupported import closures are withheld. Existing core parser/link/resolve/cells/reviewed suites test relocation, rank ranges, variants, category collisions, same-name ambiguity and broken overrides; the independent layout tests in `triageRules.test.ts` cover the changes in this round.

### Priority and maintenance

1. Preserve saved links, drafts and human statuses; apply explicit category/scope decisions, including permitted editor promotions.
2. Require current document scope/baseline; preserve current exact references and original 27 negatives.
3. Apply scoped investigations/optional priority, approved manifest-backed families, reviewed identity sets and the limited tentative negatives. A rejected source never becomes approved through a later fuzzy fallback.
4. Learned tabs, exact names and confirmed source cells may propose links; token/rename/fuzzy cases require confirmation. Unverified multipart and artifact identities remain for maintainers.

Physical cell decomposition and cooldown sharing do **not** establish item identity. Core's general combining utility is used only after category, owner/group or source-identity validation by the guided matcher; it explicitly rejects distinct artifact mechanics. The current-artifact list comes from the actual sheet section headers. Future source layouts are rediscovered by names/sections and cell evidence, not fixed row coordinates. Coordinates in generated tables are observed evidence only.

### Renamed saved links (2026-11-03)

`saved-link-content-relink`: after tab/name and relocated-name lookup fail, search logical descriptions across tracked tabs. Exactly one `sameCell` match with identical ordered multipart labels follows automatically as `moved`; multiple identical matches remain candidates. Run segmentation follows `sameCell`; styling and text must agree (no new whitespace folding).
A suggestion requires trigram Dice >=0.98 and a best/runner-up gap >=0.15. The suggested row is selected for explicit Confirm / Choose another; until confirmation it remains a repair, cannot mark reviewed, and blocks English saves. Confirmation creates a local draft with the new identity. Auto-link reports and the review queue retain the suggested row first among candidates; queue confirmation is explicit and suggestions never enter bulk acceptance. Ordered manual offsets are evaluated at each possible anchor; incomplete selections are excluded and configured descriptions never substitute for an override.
Calibration: `relink-calibration.test.ts` evaluates the 2026-10-30 reviewed-source and 2026-10-31 frozen-matcher sheets. No same-identity changed descriptions exist in their overlap; this is rename-simulation evidence, not observed rename precision. For 52 frozen current rows, punctuation, final-word deletion and numeric changes yield 155 rename-like cases plus 155 absent-identity negatives. Threshold sweep 0.85–0.98 / margin 0.05–0.15 had zero false suggestions; choose the strictest tested pair (0.98/0.15). Measured accepted-suggestion precision: 139/139 (100%); all 155 negatives withheld. The limited corpus does not establish live precision. Resolver, panel, queue and save-enricher tests cover identity/style/parts, duplicates, threshold/margin, cross-tab recovery, overrides and explicit confirmation.

### Shipped display approvals and computed cache (2026-11-04)

`approved-guidance.v1.json` started as an immutable copy of the 117 references and frozen category
membership from the read-only 2026-11-02 audit input
`ccov-audit-42488/renewed-guidance.json`. It is an app asset, never editor-data, a saved link,
or a new approval. `guidanceSchema` validates it; the existing `rebaselineGuidance` validator
renews only unchanged entry/source evidence in memory. Meaningful local references/comments
layer over their recorded categories, retaining baseline, membership and unresolved-reference
gates. No owner browser or live guidance store is used to generate the shipped snapshot.
The pinned original is `C:/Users/Seleo/AppData/Local/Temp/ccov-audit-42488/renewed-guidance.json`
(SHA-256 `2cbb42830f8fbfcbb2304319f093358f4fafeae47da3cbf3ba599796fecadb86`).
The initial committed JSON had identical parsed content; formatting changes its file hash.
The audit editor/catalog input is `ccov-sol-high-20261102/inputs.json`; the refreshed audit
source is `.agents/reports/compendium-baseline/compendium-8602377.json` in the coordination checkout.

Owner approval, 2026-11-05, ask dialog: “Approve all 3 but we gotta figure out why these weren't automatically linked up.”
This adds the 118th reference through `sampleReference`: Glacial Quake (2021620139), Stasis
(gid 1088259962), row 77, name B77, body D77:M77, and cooldown N77. Its recorded baseline,
entry evidence, source fingerprint, and styled snapshot establish the Stasis Supers convention
without changing frozen category membership. The existing `unique-name-in-learned-tab` rule
then covers Silence and Squall (2625980631), row 55, and Winter's Wrath (3683904166), row 99.
Previously, Supers references covered Arc, Solar, Void, and Strand only; all three Stasis
proposals were `uncovered-element-tab`/medium, which the display gate withholds. Other
categories' uncovered-tab proposals retained their confidence in that approval. The subsequent
owner-approved `exact-name-in-sibling-element-tab` rule above independently governs extension
to sibling element tabs; it does not promote other medium proposals.

Both the pane and Matched sources tab consume the same read-only worker results. Only
`action=link` with `confidence=high` or the existing explicit out-of-scope parent-link exceptions
is displayed as Matched. The historical 2,067-link report includes 145 medium proposals:
its display-eligible population is 1,905 high + 17 explicit parent exceptions = 1,922.
Medium proposals remain proposals, never automatic pane matches. All four Collective entries
were already withheld in that report. Current live inputs can yield fewer links when frozen
membership or reference evidence no longer validates; the counts must not be conflated.

Regenerate `precomputed.v1.json` with `node scripts/compendium-guidance/precompute.mjs` after
any matching-rule/input change. The command reads public source/catalog/bundle plus shipped
approvals and writes only that app asset. Its SHA-256 key covers all catalog definitions, aliases, tooltip evidence and tracked styled
source tabs. Fetch/build timestamps, publication/account metadata and commit-only transport
changes are excluded for pristine display; local guidance additionally keys by the current commit
so stale baseline gates remain intact. Exact matches use the compact value table; changed inputs recompute
using the same matcher in a module worker. IndexedDB caches results by input hash and compiled
worker URL (including matcher code dependencies); blocked storage falls back to memory.
Reload published data creates a new source identity. View navigation shares the in-memory
session, so it neither parses the sheet nor restarts matching. Rich-cell interning/memoization
and sheet paint containment preserve text, spans, merged-cell selections, styling and colours.

Worker replies use the same value-table representation in one transferred UTF-8 buffer per
result stage, with independently readable packets of 128 nodes inside. This preserves
Map/undefined values, physical coordinates, full rich cells and structural sharing without a
burst of structured-clone messages. Decoding runs in background-priority slices (idle callbacks
where the scheduler API is unavailable) with a 2 ms budget, checks
pending discrete and continuous input, and yields inside large array/map/object nodes. The complete,
validated match map may publish before review metadata; partial review models never publish.
Callbacks are scoped to the editor, source, account, draft/link evidence, local guidance/progress
and request revision, so an older result cannot supply another context's automatic links.
Worker review replies carry English evidence only; the UI restores original tooltip/draft
identities and all translations from its authoritative editor store before any draft operation.
Optional IndexedDB writes do not delay delivery. Memory serves pending writes, and persistent
proposal caches retain their pristine display model as a pair, including on an immediate reload.
Draft matching projects only link/classification metadata, caches unchanged draft entries and
ignores live text; the review view overlays current draft English separately. Nearby sheet context
is built only after its existing disclosure is opened; the approved description stays immediate.
The generator also emits `precomputed.v1.json.gz`. Modern browsers fetch that 1.49 MB asset;
the worker handles both HTTP-decoded and raw gzip responses. Browsers without native gzip
decompression retain the JSON fallback. Review models are prepared across all entries in
separate idle jobs, without using a selected route or predicted navigation sequence.
Closed source-picker content retains its selections but stops reconciling entry changes;
hidden visited sheets are memoized. Linked/unlinked lists render 100 entries at a time with
an explicit continuation, rather than laying out thousands of invisible rows on first opening.
The worker retains complete grids for matching and validation. Proposal/display replies carry
compact tab metadata because the UI already owns the grid; confirmation still resolves every
selected cell against that original source before creating a draft.

The source loader and matcher now share one retained worker. It fetches, parses and validates
the source once; that source is never cloned back into another matching worker. Editor input
is serialized in bounded, yielding UTF-8 chunks and its ArrayBuffers are transferred. An
editor reload replaces the initialized editor while retaining the worker's source. Unchanged
focus/storage events compare stored content before parsing, and selection-only/empty guidance
metadata changes do not invalidate matching. Same-window guidance/decision writes notify the
shared input store; actual changes still withhold old matches until validation completes.

Opening or navigating the review page derives its guidance category scaffold and baseline
renewal in memory. It never persists approval data, including an empty guidance scope, or
replays pending approval saves merely because the page mounted. Decisions, comments, imports,
explicit retries, and Send to agents authorize a persistence snapshot. Later derived changes
cannot alter that snapshot during an autosave acknowledgement or route teardown. The first
explicit edit after renewal backs up the original stored bytes before replacing them; a failed
backup leaves those original bytes intact. Queue selection, query, category, and filter are
view state: unchanged values are skipped, writes coalesce at idle, and pagehide flushes them.

Approval actions occupy normal layout space. The desktop entry footer has its own flex row;
phone entry actions and sample actions follow their content. They never float over inspection
links, disclosures, or other controls. The layout no longer measures action bars on mount.

### Earlier explicit parent/exclusion exceptions

Exotic stat parts: Exotic-owned parts always list under their exotic weapon in Exotic Weapons, never in Stat-only Parts. Whole-weapon links and tooltip scope are superseded by exoticWholeWeaponLinks. The rows below record superseded 2026-11-02 decisions for history; they authorize no current parent links. (2026-11-12, Owner 2026-11-11, applied by root 2026-11-12: “it is obviously a perk on an exotic weapon that is for that exotic weapon”.)

### Inherited narrow source-name conventions (generated from code)

Every mapping below is an existing candidate-name convention, not a new semantic approval. Category/source confirmation and parent identity gates still apply. Regression coverage lives in core link/resolve/config suites and frozen catalyst/refit examples; wrong categories, shared generic perks and unsupported parents remain counterexamples.

### Inherited stat-description exceptions (generated from code)

manifest-weapon-stat uses the following exact descriptive lead-in group, plus stat-only bullets and manifest/socket evidence. A matching lead-in alone never excludes an effect. Source: 2026-11-01, manifestRule.ts (7908a26), earlier owner-guided stat-scope implementation. Independent conditional/effect-bearing attachment counterexamples are listed in the main rule table; unknown lead-ins reject.

## Withheld and unresolved investigations

- Seven attachment sources: 1279785143, 2777563320, 1716000303, 2406549743, 137682932, 409831596, 3999527219. First six need tooltips, Remote Detonation is tentative. Base/enhanced counterpart identities inherit only that same named attachment-family decision. No parent/interaction-only source substitution.
- Elemental Siphon 3619040076: Harsh Refraction and Counter Energy are distinct mechanics. Artifact/plug mapping remains unresolved; never combine solely by name.
- Movement: the 53 group 6–8 members above remain optional, retained and unresolved for history/source investigation. Six sampled revisions in compendium-movement-history.json, compendium-hunter-jump-history.json and compendium-blink-history.json recovered no text; this is not proof none existed.
- The Fundamentals 2620589274/3081173348, Ergo Sum Catalyst 1497627200 and general Caster Frame 183772609 retain their unresolved owner references; only frame-specific coverage can resolve sword frames.
- Source changes, unsupported names, conflicting category/identity evidence, missing manifest facts, partial dependencies and ambiguous candidates retain explicit owner-review reasons rather than guessed equivalence.
- Deferred to separate work: manifest-removal archive and lost-tooltip checker/recovery. Root verified 153/159 cleared texts were never human-edited manifest copies; Ricochet Rounds contained the real sharper-angle addition. Concussion, Proximity and Remote Detonation history was manifest paraphrase. No archival, resurrection or history rewriting is performed by this matcher.
