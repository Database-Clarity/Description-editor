# Clarity description editor v2

This branch is the foundation for the new Clarity editor. The app currently lets you
navigate between placeholder screens; it does **not** load, edit, or publish live data.
The production editor remains unchanged on `main`.

## Get started

1. Install Node.js 20.19 or newer (Node 20 is used in CI).
2. Open a terminal in this repository's top-level folder.
3. Run `npm ci` to install all workspace dependencies.
4. Run `npm run dev -- --port 5173 --strictPort`.
5. Open http://localhost:5173/ in your browser.

Stop the server with Ctrl+C. Changes to the web source appear automatically.
If port 5173 is busy, stop your own old server or choose a different port.

## Where things live

| Folder/file                       | Purpose                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `apps/web/`                       | React browser app; see its README for a source-code map.                                                                                                   |
| `apps/web/src/features/`          | Editor, navigation, review, Compendium, globals, and other feature folders.                                                                                |
| `apps/web/src/ui/`                | Shared UI components and styles.                                                                                                                           |
| `apps/web/src/services/`          | Future data access, kept separate from components.                                                                                                         |
| `packages/*`                      | Shared packages, including the separately developed pure TypeScript `core` package.                                                                        |
| `apps/worker/` (planned)          | Future server-side authentication and GitHub writes.                                                                                                       |
| `legacy/`                         | Untouched old app, kept as **read-only reference** while porting. Not a workspace; excluded from lint, tests, formatting, and builds. Deleted at cut-over. |
| `tsconfig.json`                   | Shared strict TypeScript settings; workspace configs extend these.                                                                                         |
| `eslint.config.js`                | Shared lint rules, including React hooks and no explicit `any`.                                                                                            |
| `.github/workflows/v2-checks.yml` | Checks for pushes and pull requests targeting `v2`. The old deployment workflow is unchanged.                                                              |

Run commands from the repository root: npm workspaces installs dependencies together,
so you do not need to install each app separately. Workspaces cover `apps/*` and
`packages/*`, never `legacy/`. The preserved legacy manifest and lockfile describe the
old dependencies; do not install or develop there.

## Everyday commands

| Command             | What it does                                                                              |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`       | Starts the web development server.                                                        |
| `npm run typecheck` | Checks TypeScript in every workspace that provides a typecheck script.                    |
| `npm run lint`      | Checks active code for common mistakes.                                                   |
| `npm test`          | Runs Vitest tests across apps and packages; succeeds if no tests exist yet.               |
| `npm run build`     | Builds every workspace that provides a build script; web output goes to `apps/web/dist/`. |
| `npm run format`    | Formats active source and documentation with Prettier; skips legacy.                      |

To check your work, run typecheck, lint, test, and build before opening a pull request.
All four also run in CI after `npm ci`. New workspaces should expose `typecheck` and
`build` scripts as needed; name tests `*.test.ts`, `*.spec.ts`, or their TSX equivalents.

## Navigation

The app uses hash URLs so refreshing a link works on static hosting:

- `#/t/123`: tooltip editor (any tooltip hash).
- `#/review`: changes waiting for review.
- `#/compendium`: Compendium tracking.
- `#/drift`: in-game description changes.
- `#/translations`: translation status.
- `#/globals`: shared variables and titles.
- `#/globals/variables/example`: one global and, later, its usage links.
- `#/admin`: administration.

The left navigation uses normal router links, so browser back/forward works.
SCSS modules, original theme colors, and the DestinySymbols font keep the familiar
dark-and-orange look. No connection to production services is made by this shell.
